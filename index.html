      <p><strong>Peek-a-boo</strong> is an ancient game riddled in mystery and deceit. Though it appears to be an innocent children's pastime, you may change your mind when you learn of its treacherous history.</p>

          Polar bears roam the Arctic ice sheets and swim in that region's coastal waters. They are very strong swimmers, and their large front paws, which they use to paddle, are slightly webbed. Some polar bears have been seen swimming hundreds of miles from land—though they probably cover most of that distance by floating on sheets of ice.

          Polar bears live in one of the planet's coldest environments and depend on a thick coat of insulated fur, which covers a warming layer of fat. Fur even grows on the bottom of their paws, which protects against cold surfaces and provides a good grip on ice. The bear's stark white coat provides camouflage in surrounding snow and ice. But under their fur, polar bears have black skin—the better to soak in the sun's warming rays. <span class="info-click">Click here</span> to hide this text.

          The deep core tests have revealed facts about the CO2 (carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere.  There is a natural up and down range that the levels have, these levels have never gone over 300 parts per million, that is until recent years.  Now what does this mean?  It means that some of the carbon dioxide that used to leave the Earth's atmosphere is now remaining inside the atmosphere.  The carbon  dioxide that is remaining on earth, also known as greenhouse gases, is raising  the earth's temperature, causing the "Greenhouse Effect."

          Now you may wonder what all of this has to do with the polar bears.  The polar bears live in a very sensitive environment.   The  arctic region is made of snow and ice.  Snow and ice is what the polar bears depend on for their survival.  The "Greenhouse Effect" warms the earth, and therefore, melts the precious snow and ice that the polar bears need for survival.

          So it is easy to deduce from this, that we, humans, are the cause of the polar bears being threatened.  We are slowly killing the planet and most of us are oblivious to it.  Global warming can be slowed down, the polar bears do have  a chance. <span class="danger-click">Click here</span> to hide this text.
